# Svelto.ECS.Tests

You should be able to download all the necessary to run the test through nuget. All the information should be already included in the solution, so it should be an automatic process.

These tests runs with .net core, they DO NOT USE UNITY. Unity dedicated tests are found at https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Tests.Unity

## Feel free to contribute with new tests, all valid PRs will be accepted and appreciated!
